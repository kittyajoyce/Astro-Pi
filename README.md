# Astro-Pi

Kitty and Niamh's Astro Pi project

**Note from Danny Murray:** Hi guys! Great work! I ran your code (https://gist.github.com/MrDMurray/8dfef7db6d64cba850e82f4d2902ffd7) on the flight OS here and it ran with no issues. The total file size was 1.6GB with 660 photos. I was able to open the csv file with

```bash
sudo nano nk.py

```

The only thing I was going to suggest was update the headers but I see from your latest main.py that you've already done that! Well done! Hope we all get nice photos from space!
